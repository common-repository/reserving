Reserving is designed for restaurants and food delivery services, helping manage online reservations, table bookings, and efficient delivery operations.

== Description ==

Reserving Online Food Ordering & Reservation Plugin is an online food ordering system & table management system for restaurants and businesses. Reserving is a WordPress plugin-based solution that enables developers to easily integrate powerful delivery management features and facilities into their WordPress website.

This essential plugin for restaurants comes with awesome management features such as invoice printing, order printing, assigning tasks based on managerial roles, viewing order status, tracking orders until delivery/serving, payment information management, making quick changes to orders or cancellations, enabling or disabling access to information based on managerial roles, and so much more.

And for customer convenience, the Reserving Reservation Plugin offers features such as a fast & responsive availability checker for branches, tables, and food courses. 

Customers are able to log in, book/reserve tables, order food, track their delivery status, tip servers and delivery persons from the cart/checkout, select branches, check timings, and more. 

Once users place their orders online, those orders go straight to your kitchen staff, who will prepare them according to their specifications. From then on until their delivery date, employees will make sure everything goes as planned by checking the order status every step of the way. 

Customers can even schedule food orders with detailed specifications & selectable add-ons ahead of time, just as they can reserve tables and seatings for diners.

Implementing a food delivery & restaurant food order management system in WordPress is easy with Reserving, and since it comes with seamless integration with WooCommerce, adding new food items, managing reviews, payments, and placing orders is super simple.

Reserving is a great choice for fast food, takeout, and restaurant businesses because it has a powerful management system and is easy to customize so that more features can be added to your website as you see fit.
